## Project Overview

The Implementation of Steganography project is a collaborative effort by three members to create an open-source website that supports various types of steganography, including image, audio, text, and video.

## Key Features

- Support for image steganography
- Support for audio steganography
- Support for text steganography
- Support for video steganography

## Steps for Using Image Steganography

Here are the typical steps for using image steganography:
1. Select a cover image: Choose an innocuous-looking image file such as a photo to hide secret data within. Using a complex image with more data (e.g. photo vs. simple graphic) makes detection harder.
2. Convert secret message to binary: Transform the text, audio, or video file to a series of 0s and 1s according to its ASCII/binary representation.
3. Embed data in cover image: Use a steganography tool/library and algorithm like LSB insertion to modify the least significant bits of pixels in the cover image according to the binary secret data.
4. Save the resulting stego-image: This is the cover image with the secret message embedded and indistinguishable to human eyes or basic analysis.
5. Extract hidden data: Open the stego-image in a tool that can detect and extract the hidden binary data using the same algorithm.
6. Convert extracted data to original form: Transform the extracted binary data back to the original text, image, audio or video file format.
